There are multiple options to create and import a wallet in Lucid. In this
section we are using the private key method.\
If you are curious about other methods head over to
[Wallet](../components/wallet.md).

In case you have no private key yet, you can generate one with Lucid:

```js
const privateKey = lucid.utils.generatePrivateKey(); // Bech32 encoded private key
console.log(privateKey);
```

Now we select a private key wallet with our Lucid instance:

```js
lucid.selectWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

**Note:** In almost all cases you want to select a wallet. It's necessary to
build and submit transactions.
